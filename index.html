Tango Trees

This is a polymorphic C implementation of Tango Trees. 

Tango trees were originally published by Erik Demaine, Dion Harmon, John Iacono 
and Mihai Patrascu in their 2004 paper, "Dynamic Optimality--Almost".

Using a complex series of rotations, joins, concatenates, and other operations, 
tango trees achieve an O(lg lg n)-competitive runtime.
